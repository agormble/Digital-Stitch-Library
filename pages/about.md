## Cross Stitch Patterns

<i>Cross stitch is a form of counted thread embroidery that has been around for ages, and it is one of the easiest forms of hand embroidery to learn. Cross stitch is comprised of X-shaped stitches done on fabric with an even and open weave like Aida or linen. Designs can be traditional or modern or anywhere in between.</i>

This collection was created as a way for me to keep track of various cross stitch patterns that I had downloaded over a few years. I envisioned it as a way to easily find and access patterns that I might not know the name of but knew laregly the elements the pattern contained. My cross stitch projects are generally created as gifts for friends. And having a place to sort out the patterns I have, would make it easy to find a gift I wanted to make. All patterns are free to use by their respective creators.
